# Course Materials and Structure

The lecturer notes for this course have been written in R Markdown and will be provided to you at the end of the course.

There are a number of exercise files provided for you on the desktop in the folder "R and Shiny".

The course will follow this general structure:

# Questions

Before continuing with the course, I'd like to understand everyone's experience with R thus far:

- Who has never used R before?
- Who has used RStudio?
- Who has used Projects in RStudio?
- Who has used ggplot2?
- Who is familiar with what this is called %>% and why it's used?
- Who has heard of the tidyverse?
- Who has heard of htmlwidgets? Who has used them?
- Who has used Shiny?

# Course Overview

This course is designed to introduce you to the basics of creating interactive data visualisations using R; with two very different technologies:

- RMarkdown
- Shiny

No prior knowledge of R is expected, the necessary "programming patterns" and workflows will be introduced through the course.

Please note that this course will **NOT** provide a sufficient overview of the R language to start analysing data and doing useful stuff.

>* This course shows you how to make Shiny stuff.

# Scope of Course

This course is a trojan horse for a variety of messages:

- R is amazing

- R is great for creating interactive data visualisations

- R provides an excellent workflow for reproducible research; combining code with data, textual explanations and interactive data visualisations.

# Scope of Course

This course covers the following topics:

>- Building interactive maps, networks and charts using htmlwidgets

# Maps with leaflet

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
library(readr)
locations <- read_csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5449670")
leaflet(locations) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers()
```

# Networks with visNetwork

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(visNetwork)
library(igraph)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
## DOI: 10.4169/mathhorizons.23.4.18, nodes connected when within 15 words of one another
game_of_thrones <- read_csv("https://www.macalester.edu/~abeverid/data/stormofswords.csv")

game_of_thrones_igraph <- game_of_thrones %>%
  rename(from = Source, to = Target, width = Weight) %>%
  mutate(width = width / 5) %>%
  graph.data.frame(directed = FALSE)

V(game_of_thrones_igraph)$title <- V(game_of_thrones_igraph)$name
## Attribute due to https://github.com/datastorm-open/visNetwork/issues/74
V(game_of_thrones_igraph)$color <- rep("#1b9e77", vcount(game_of_thrones_igraph))

game_of_thrones_igraph %>%
  visIgraph(idToLabel = FALSE) %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE) %>%
  visEdges(color = list(color = "#d95f02"))
```

# Charts with plotly and highcharter

Plotly

```{r, echo=TRUE}
desktopItems <- read_csv(file = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5360960")
library(plotly)
g <- ggplot(desktopItems,
         aes(y = `Desktop Items`, 
             x = `University`, 
             fill = `Operating System`)
         ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + coord_flip()
ggplotly(g)
```

Highcharter

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(highcharter)
library(tidyr)

desktopItems_hc <- desktopItems %>%
  group_by(University, `Operating System`) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Desktop Items`)) %>%
  group_by(`Operating System`) %>%
  complete(`Operating System`) %>%
  spread(`Operating System`, total)

highchart() %>% 
  hc_xAxis(categories = desktopItems_hc$University, title = "University") %>%
  hc_add_series(name = "Windows 10", data = desktopItems_hc$`Windows 10`) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = "Windows 7", data = desktopItems_hc$`Windows 7`) %>%
  hc_chart(type = "bar")
```

# Scope of Course

This course covers the following topics:

- Building interactive maps, networks and charts using htmlwidgets

<div class="incremental"> 
- Writing documents/presentations using RMarkdown; including text, code and interactive output in the same document
</div>

# RPubs

[RPubs.com](rpubs.com) is a free and open platform for publishing and sharing HTML RMarkdown documents with others.

RPubs and Shiny are both maintained by the team behind RStudio and are fully integrated into the IDE.

Note that while documents hosted on RPubs are made public, the underlying code/.rmd files cannot be downloaded by others.

# Basic Shiny Example

This is an example of a shiny app from the [shiny.rstudio.com](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/tabsets.html) website:

  # and number of observations to generate. Note the use of the
  # br() element to introduce extra vertical spacing
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      radioButtons("dist", "Distribution type:",
                   c("Normal" = "norm",

# Interactive Data Network

In IT Services we're piloting a service to support researchers in developing interactive data visualisations to provide exploratory interfaces to their research and data - and Shiny is a core component of this.

Some of the case studies we've worked on are available at [idn.web.ox.ac.uk](idn.web.ox.ac.uk), there are also great example at [http://www.showmeshiny.com/](http://www.showmeshiny.com/) and stunning examples at [daattali.com/shiny/](https://daattali.com/shiny/)

# Scope of Course

This course covers the following topics:

- Building interactive maps, networks and charts using htmlwidgets

- Writing documents/presentations using RMarkdown; including text, code and interactive output in the same document

- Build interactive web applications using Shiny for exploring datasets using htmlwidget visualisations, without any* knowledge of HTML or JavaScript

While this course has "Shiny" in the title, I really want you to see that sometimes htmlwidgets (and other RStudio technologies) will do!
