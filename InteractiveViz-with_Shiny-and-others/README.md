# Interactive Visualisations with Shiny and R

This talk is primarily given as part of the [Oxford ITLP](courses.it.ox.ac.uk) lunchtime talk sessions but is also used for promoting R as a tool for building interactive data visualisations more generally.

Note that this folder includes "Data_Visualisation_is_Important.pdf" which was produced using Google Slides. This short presentation posits that data visualisation is regulated to PDF furniture, if used at all, but that researchers should consider interactive data visualisation as an effective tool for making data explorable.
